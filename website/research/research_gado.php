                               The perturbation on the relaxation of solvent water protons induced by the presence of paramagnetic metal-containing systems has been exploited for the design of contrast agents
                                in Magnetic Resonance Imaging applications. Complexes of Gd<sup>3+</sup> ion have been early identified as the candidates of choice and several, highly stable, Gd-containing contrast agents 
                                have entered in the clinical practice already two-three decades ago. Basically Gd-complexes are chemicals that affect the relaxation rates (R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>) of the water protons in
                                 the regions where they distribute. Actually, Gd<sup>3+</sup>  ion (seven unpaired electrons, long electronic relaxation time) was immediately recognized as the paramagnetic ion of choice.<br />
                                  Moreover, the coordination chemistry of this metal ion was already sufficiently known and several ligands (in particular polyamino-polycarboxylates) were already proved to be able
                                   to wrap around the Gd<sup>3+</sup>  ion to form highly stable complexes. The requirement of a high thermodynamic (and kinetic) stability is a key requisite for these complexes to be 
                                   considered as potential CAs for in vivo applications. <br />

                                The chemistry of Gd-complexes is one of the first research line which has been tackled at CIM. It starts from the synthesis of differently functionalized Gd-based probes and continues
                                 to their relaxometric characterization for the in depth elucidation of the relationships between structure and dynamics of paramagnetic metal complexes and the determinants 
                                 of their proton relaxation enhancement. Moreover, all the new Gd-complexes which are here synthetized and characterized are tested for their specific function in vitro 
                                 (at the cellular level) and/or in vivo (in specific animal models).<br /><br />
                                 
                                On this basis, at CIM a number of Gd-containing complexes are synthetized and tested:<br />
