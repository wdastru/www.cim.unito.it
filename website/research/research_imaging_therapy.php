							The synergy between Imaging and Therapy gave the birth to the
							neologism &quot;Theranosis&quot; that represents a new research
							area where imaging is not merely used for diagnostic purposes,
							but it offers to pharmacologists and physicians a robust tool for
							assessing the therapeutic outcome. Typical applications of
							Theranosis include the in vivo assessment of drug biodistribution
							and accumulation at the target site, visualization of the drug
							release from a given nanocarrier, and real-time monitoring of the
							therapeutic effect.<br> Most of the theranostic procedures
							requires the use of specific imaging probes, named theranostic
							agents. The expected end-point of theranostic agents is to
							provide a fundamental support for the optimization of innovative
							diagnostic and therapeutic strategies that could significantly
							contribute to achieve important advances in the field of the
							&quot;personalized medicine&quot;.<br> Theranosis is intimately
							linked with nanomedicine, because nanocarriers, besides improving
							the therapeutic index of a drug and reducing side effects, can be
							easily loaded with imaging probes. First, the imaging-detectable
							nanocarrier can be administered without the drug to evaluate its
							ability to reach the biological target. Then, the theranostic
							nanomedicine can be injected and imaging can monitor the
							effective delivery of the drug as well as its release from the
							nanocarrier.<br> Another important application area of Theranosis
							is the support that imaging provides to cellular and regenerative
							therapies. Here, in general, therapeutic cells are labelled with
							imaging probes that make possible to localize with accuracy the
							transplantation site of the cells or to track the destiny of
							cells after their injection.<br> However, imaging can support not
							only pharmacological or cellular therapies, but can have a strong
							and beneficial impact on surgery. Most of the clinical
							interventional procedures are guided by human vision and
							perception. However, human eyes are not sensitive or accurate
							enough in detecting the cellular or molecular signature of a
							given disease. For this reason, advanced optical and
							opto-acoustic methods have been considering to complement human
							vision for making clinical decision during interventions.<br> <br>
							In our Center, several theranostic procedure have been developed
							and preclinically validated aimed at: <br>

							<li>assessing by MRI the release of a drug (e.g. doxorubicin)
								from a nanocarrier (liposomes) triggered by a local application
								of low intensity ultrasound</li>
							<li>providing a fluorescent guide to discriminate tumor and
								healthy tissue in prostatectomy</li>
