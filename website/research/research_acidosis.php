							Upregulated glucose metabolism, as a consequence of increased
							lactate and H<sup>+</sup> extrusion from anaerobic glycolysis,
							even in presence of sufficient oxygen (&quot;Warburg
							effect&quot;), associated with acidification of the extracellular
							space (pHe 6.2-6.8) is one of the major features of cancer.
							However, tumor cells are well adapted to acidic
							microenvironments, since they rely on proton exchangers and
							transports, which exports protons to the microenvironment.
							Several pH regulators are therefore involved in preserving such
							pH homeostasis, including ATPases, Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>
							exchangers (NHEs), monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) carbonic
							anhydrases (CAs) and anion exchangers (AEs). Moreover, tumor
							acidification (or tumor acidosis) has been associated with key
							features of cancer aggressiveness, including invasion, increase
							angiogenesis and resistance to therapy and evasion from the
							immune system.<br> <br> It is becoming increasingly evident that
							extracellular acidosis could be targeted to block tumor
							proliferation using for example proton pump inhibitors, which are
							first responsible of H<sup>+</sup> exporting mechanism. Even more
							important is that changes in the level of acidosis can be used as
							a marker of therapeutic response. As a consequence, novel imaging
							approaches are urgently needed for non-invasively assessing the
							efficacy of novel anticancer therapies.<br> <br> To date,
							imaging-based methods are commonly used in clinical settings to
							assess glucose metabolism (using FDG-PET), providing a formidable
							tool for evaluating treatment response. However, significant
							shortcomings of FDG-PET approach are related to radiation
							exposure (limiting repeated exams in a single individual) and to
							radioactive compound <sup>18</sup>F production (local cyclotron
							owing to the short half-life) which cannot be found in every
							hospital. Conversely, an effective imaging method that allows to
							quantify extracellular tumor pH and to assess pHe related changes
							following therapeutic treatment is still missing. <br> Other
							imaging-based approaches, namely magnetic resonance spectroscopy
							(MRS) and imaging (MRI) have been investigated. However, none of
							them has shown feasibility to provide pHe maps with sufficient
							spatial resolution and pH accuracy and to be easily translated
							into clinical settings.<br> <br> Recently, MRI-CEST (Chemical
							Exchange Saturation Transfer) based methods for measuring pHe
							with improved accuracy, concentration-independence and spatial
							resolution have been proposed and investigated in preclinical
							tumor models (Longo D et al., Cancer Research 2016, 76, 6463). <br>
							<b>Consequently, MRI-CEST pH imaging can play a role as an
								alternative to FDG-PET to characterize tumor metabolism and for
								assessing treatment response.</b><br> <br> Within our center we
							have developed several
							<a

								style="color: #dc6a10"> CEST-based pH sensors </a>
							for the non-invasive assessment of tumor pH. Among them, clinical
							approved radiographic contrast agents such as
							<a
								href="research_cest.php"
								style="color: #dc6a10">Iopamidol, iobitridol and iodixanol</a>
							have been exploited for measuring tumor pHe in murine tumor
							models. Moreover, we have investigated lanthanide
							<a

								style="color: #dc6a10">PARACEST complexes (Yb-HPDO3A)</a>
							to measure extracellular pH.<br> <br> We are interested to
							assess:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>the relationship between tumor acidosis and glucose uptake,</li>
							<li>the role of tumor acidosis in cancer progression and
								invasion,</li>
							<li>tumor pHe imaging as a biomarker of treatment response to
								novel anticancer therapies.</li>
