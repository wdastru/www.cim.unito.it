                                Such class of agents is based on the
                                magnetization transfer of saturation on the water NMR signal. The
                                amount of such a transfer depends on a number of factors (number of
                                exchangeable protons in the CEST agent and their rate of exchange,
                                intensity of the saturating RF field, ... ). The following
                                activities are under development:

                                        Non-spherical liposomes that contain chemical
                                        shift agents both in the inner cavity and on the membrane are used.
                                        We have already demonstrated that such category of liposomes
                                        (LipoCEST) is particularly suited because it produces big shifts of
                                        the intraliposomial water proton resonance; the latter are well
                                        accepted as they permit to exploit high values of the exchange rate
                                        K <sub>ex</sub>. The aim of the research is to produce a series of
                                        systems that differ for the irradiation frequency; they will be
                                        used both unmodified and functionalized in order to make them

                                    <p class="indent">
                                        Iopamidol is one of the most used contrast agent
                                        for X-ray CT scans. It contains three iodine atoms (that makes it
                                        an X-ray opaque agent) and three amides functionalities that could
                                        act as a pool of exchanging protons, making it a potential CEST
                                        agent. Being it a diamagnetic species, the amide chemical shifts
                                        are near to the water chemical shift and this feature could
                                        potentially harm its role as a CEST agent, because of the extensive
                                        direct saturation of the water signal. We then carefully adjusted
                                        the acquisition of the images and developed post-processing
                                        procedures in order to definitely extract its true CEST
                                        contribution to the image. For the sake of sensitivity, the target
                                        organ was identified in the kidney, being the region where
                                        iopamidol accumulates prior to urinary excretion. The possibility
                                        to develop a protocol to quantitatively extract the efficacy of
                                        glomerular filtration on a voxelwise basis is under intense
                                        scrutiny.

                                        The intrinsic mechanism of action of the CEST
                                        agents implies that the effect itself could be observed not only in
                                        the voxels where the agent distributes, but also from voxels that
                                        do not contain any quantity of the agent. The effective observation
                                        of such phenomenon depends on a number of factors such as the
                                        duration of the irradiation, the CEST agent concentration, the
                                        existence of favorable diffusion pathways ... It is our intention
                                        to develop diagnostic agents and protocols that exploit this
                                        peculiar characteristic of the CEST effect.

                                        could act both as T <sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>and as CEST agents.
                                        However, when these agents are captured by macrophages, the CEST
                                        effect is lost, while the T <sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>contribution
                                        to the image remains. It then follows that by comparing the CEST
                                        vs. the T <sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>effects in the MRI images, a map
                                        of the macrophages sequestration activity could in principle be
                                        obtained.

                                        The main problem dealing with the use of LipoCEST
                                        agents, is their limited blood half-life time because of the
                                        sequestration by macrophages. For targeting applications it is then
                                        essential to develop new systems with longer blood half-life time.
                                        Polymersomes could represent useful alternatives to liposomes for
                                        these applications; they are made of block-polymers (containig both
                                        lipophilic and hydrophilic regions) that tack together in way
                                        similar to phospholipids in the membranes of liposomes. It has been
                                        verified that polymersomes loaded with paramagnetic chemical shift
                                        reagents could be a real alternative to <i>in vivo</i>LipoCEST
