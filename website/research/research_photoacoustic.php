							Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a new biomedical imaging modality
							based on the use of laser-generated ultrasounds that emerged over
							the last decade. A PA image can be considered as an ultrasound
							image in which the contrast depend from optical properties of the
							tissue, particularly the optical absorption. As a consequence, it
							offers greater specificity than conventional ultrasound with the
							ability to detect, and spectroscopically distinguish,
							light-absorbing chromophores including endogenous molecules
							(e.g., hemoglobin, melanin, lipids).<br> The ideal photoacoustic
							contrast agent should be characterized by a distinct absorption
							spectrum in the near-infrared (NIR) optical window (600-1100 nm),
							where endogenous chromophores (e.g., hemoglobin, water) have
							relatively low absorption; this feature allows to maximize
							penetration depth by avoiding the strong absorption of intrinsic
							chromophore. Moreover, also a fluorescent dye can be used in PA
							imaging, but a low fluorescent quantum yield is preferable and
							results in more efficient signal generation, as the non-radiative
							conversion of light energy to heat is maximize. High
							photo-stability is also important to ensure that spectral
							features are not changed by light irradiation.<br> The
							photoacoustic signal is tested in vitro by means of an agar
							phantom and the most promising contrast agents are tested in vivo
							in healthy and tumor bearing mice. For those dyes that are also
							fluorescent, optical imaging is performed to validate the results
							obtained with photoacoustic imaging. The following contrast
							agents are currently under investigation for photoacoustic
							imaging applications. <br>

							<li><b>Small-molecules dyes </b>
								<p class="indent">There is a range of small molecule dyes that
									absorb in the NIR window and thus can be used for PAI. The
									chemical basis of these dyes is a series of conjugated double
									bonds and/or ring systems. The heptamethine cyanine dye,
									Indocyanine green (ICG), is FDA-approved dyes that can be used
									for both fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging (off-label).
									Beyond these FDA approved dyes, there are others, not approved
									for human use, such as targeted ICG (ICG-RGD), IRDye800CW,
									Cyanine5.5, AlexaFluor750 and metal Phthalocyanine (M-Pc) that
									are investigated as photoacoustic probes in vitro.</p></li>
							<li><b>Nanoparticles and microbubbles</b>
								<p class="indent">As photoacoustic contrast agents, both
									metallic and organic nanoparticles are investigated.
									Iron/silica/gold core-shell nanoparticles are synthesized and
									tested in vivo for photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging
									of ovarian cancer. Gold nanorods (AuNRs) are characterized by
									an extinction coefficient several orders of magnitude higher
									than that of small-molecule dyes due to the localized surface
									plasmon resonance phenomenon. However, biocompatibility in vivo
									needs further investigation. IndoCyanine Green based
									nanoparticles are extensively investigated, indeed ICG is
									encapsulated inside the pores of pegylated amino-functionalized
									Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (ICG-MSNs), furthermore ICG is
									loaded on Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (ICG-SLN) liposomes and
									microbubbles. The loading of dyes on nanoparticles enhanced dye
									solubility and photostability and prolonged circulation time
									increasing tumor uptake. Moreover, due to fluorescence
									quenching of the encapsulated dyes an enhanced photoacoustic
									signal is observed in vitro and in vivo. Melanin-containing
									nanoparticles are recently synthesized and tested as
									photoacoustic contrast agents. Another innovative application
									is the cell tracking via ICG labeled macrophage.</p></li>
