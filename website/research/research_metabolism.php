							The term cancer does not refer to a single disorder, but to a
							large number of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth
							of abnormal or mutated cells in the body that have the ability to
							proliferate and infiltrate normal body tissue. Cancer metabolism
							is one of the oldest and most important field of research in
							biology, by some fifty years, also because cancers are one of the
							leading cause of death in Western countries. Over time, there has
							been an increase of survival rates for many types of tumours,
							thanks to available screening programmes and treatments&#39;
							improvement.<br> Researches related to tumour metabolism are
							based on the principle that cancer cells exhibit altered
							metabolic activities relative to normal cells, as originally
							observed by Otto Warburg almost 100 years ago. The energetics
							reprogramming, that allows to take up abundant nutrients to
							produce ATP, and increased localised ROS are considered a
							hallmark of cancer.<br> Glycolysis is an early attractive target
							for understanding cancer, as many tumours show a significant
							increase in glucose uptake compared with adjacent normal tissue.
							Cancer cells are able to maintain a high rate of glycolysis even
							under oxygen&minus;sufficient conditions, a process known as
							aerobic glycolysis or Warburg effect. This observation is at the
							basis of [<sup>18</sup>F]&minus;fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation
							in tumour tissues used in positron emission tomography
							(FDG&minus;PET).<br> In last decades, hyperpolarized (HP) probes
							have provided a unique tool for the non-invasive assessment of
							altered metabolic conditions through magnetic resonance (MR)
							spectroscopy and imaging. <sup>13</sup>C&minus;HP pyruvate,
							obtained using dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization
							(d&minus;DNP) and more recently by Parahydrogen Induced
							Hyperpolarization (PHIP), is the most widely applied HP
							metabolite. Unfortunately, the wide application of this powerful
							diagnostic method is limited to few laboratories due to the high
							costs of the polarizer.
