							Angiogenesis is commonly indicated as a hallmark of cancer. It
							involves the formation of new capillaries from pre-existing
							vessels for ensuring the blood support necessary to tumor
							expansion and metastasis to distant organs. In cancer biology,
							this process is highly deregulated. As a consequence, tumor
							vasculature displays a highly destructured and dysfunctional
							network, mainly characterized by hyperpermeability and reduced
							tumor perfusion. These structural features contribute to vascular
							heterogeneity and impair tumor blood flow responsible of hypoxia,
							interstitial pressure and acidosis. Therefore, several
							therapeutic strategies are under investigation tonormalize the
							tumor vasculature throughout antiangiogenic therapies for
							improving blood perfusion and for decreasing level of hypoxia
							that makes the cells resistant to radiotherapy and cytotoxic
							agents. <br> Several imaging techniques have been developed to
							visualize these structural abnormalities.

								<p class="indent">
									In our lab we develop MRI-based functional approaches in order
									to characterize tumor angiogenesis in several murine models and
									evaluate the response to pharmacological treatments. We mainly
									focus on DCE&minus;MRI technique, that allows the visualization
									of tumor vasculature by exploiting the injection of pre
									clinical/clinical Gd<sup>3+</sup>&minus;based contrast agents
									informative of tumor perfusion and permeability. In particular,
									we recently developed a novel
									<a

										style="color: #dc6a10">blood pool agent (Gd-AAZTA Madec)</a>
									able to provide an accurate quantification of intratumoral
									vessels at low magnetic field, therefore facilitating the
									translation of our approach. In combination with the superb
									anatomical resolution of MRI, this technique allows the
									implementation of dedicated tools able to analyse tumor
									heterogeneity and visualize its role in modulating the response
									to therapy.

									In addition, our research recently focused on the development
									of MRI perfusion agents able to be detected by the
									<a
										href="research_cest.php"
										style="color: #dc6a10">chemical exchange saturation transfer
										approach (CEST)</a>
									, in order to provide alternatives to Gd<sup>3+</sup>&minus;based
									contrast agents.

									We are exploring also macromolecular biodegradable
									<a

									based on the natural plaftorm of melanin, to provide tumor
