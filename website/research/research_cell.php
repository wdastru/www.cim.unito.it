                                Cellular labeling is a real medical need to
                                forehead the growing interest in topics such stem cells and
                                cellular therapy. New methodologies are needed that allow the <i>in
                                vivo</i>observation of administered cells, both in terms of their
                                localization and functioning. The most suitable imaging technique
                                for such applications is represented by Magnetic Resonance Imaging
                                (MRI) both for its high spatial resolution and limited
                                invasiveness. Besides the work on the improvement of the
                                pinocytosis labelling procedure using polinuclear complexes of Gd
                                (neutral and very hydrophilic), the work at CIM is oriented towards
                                the following lines of research:

                                        The aim is to entrap sufficient amounts of
                                        contrast agents inside the endosomial vescicles within minutes
                                        since their administration, taking advantage of this mechanism of
                                        endocytosis. In order to increase the number of units of contrast
                                        agent internalized we make use of "nanocarriers" like liposomes or
                                        analogue structures. On their external surface, suitable functions
                                        will be inserted in order to target the receptor of interest. As an
                                        example, liposomes functionalized with ialuronic acid chains on
                                        their external surface are prepared and filled up with complexes of
                                        Gd. The ialuronic acid is a ligand for the CD44 membrane receptor.
                                        The ialuronic acid can be covalently or non-covalently conjugated
                                        to the surface of the liposome. In the latter case, cationic
                                        liposomes are used so that negatively charged ialuronic acid
                                        ligands can electrostatically cover the liposome surface.
