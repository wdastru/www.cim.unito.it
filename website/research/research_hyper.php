							<h2>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP)</h2>
							The material to be polarized is dissolved in a glass-forming
							solvent (glycerol, ethanol or dimethylsulfoxide), or it can be
							used as it is if it forms a glassy structure when lowering the
							temperature. It is then doped with a stable radical species and
							then placed into the magnetic field, brought to very low
							temperature (1-2 K) and irradiated with a proper microwave
							frequency, at or near to the electron resonance frequency. Under
							these conditions, polarization transfer from electrons (whose
							polarization approaches 100% in this temperature range) to nuclei
							occurs via flip-flop transitions. The very unefficient nuclear
							relaxation in the solid ensures the maintenance of the nuclear
							spins alignment during the process. After the polarization
							transfer has taken place, the RF is switched off, the sample is
							raised above the liquid Helium level and is rapidly dissolved in
							hot buffer still inside the magnetic field. This dissolution
							method allows to rapidly reach the body temperature without
							significant loss of polarization. The sample is then injected
							into alive animals or added to cells suspensions for MRI/MRS
							acquisitions.

							<h2>Para-Hydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP)</h2>
							The hydrogen molecule exists as two different nuclear spin
							isomers: ortho-hydrogen (o-H <sub>2</sub>), corresponding to a
							triply degenerate state (S=1, 75% natural abundance), in which
							the two nuclear spins are parallel, and parahydrogen (p-H <sub>2</sub>),
							corresponding to a singlet state (S=0, 25% abundance), in which
							the two nuclear spins are antiparallel. It is possible to enrich
							hydrogen in the para form at low temperature in the presence of a
							paramagnetic catalyst. The PHIP procedure is based on the
							chemical reaction of hydrogen enriched in the para form (commonly
							termed as para-hydrogen) with unsaturated substrates. The
							imbalance in the spin population of the para-hydrogen molecule is
							transferred to the product molecules, which result then
							transformed into hyperpolarized systems. In the hydrogenated
							molecule, polarization transfer to heteronuclei occurs via scalar
							couplings.

								An hyperpolarized state is defined as a state in which the
								nuclear spin populations are altered with respect to the
								equilibrium value described by the Boltzmann equation. Since the
								signal intensity is proportional to the spin populations
								difference, hyperpolarization leads to an increase in the NMR
								signal intensity which may reach values as high as 10<sup>5</sup>.
								This can be exploited in the fast acquisition of high resolution
								MR images and spectra and allows to use nuclei other than
								protons, allowing to obtain images which are characterized by
								high signal to noise (S/N) ratios and free from background noise
								because of the low natural abundance of heteronuclei such as <sup>13</sup>C
								and <sup>15</sup>N. With hyperpolarized contrast agents, images
								are acquired by the direct detection of the heteronucleus and
								the contrast is given by the difference in signal intensity
								between regions reached by the hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C
								molecule and uninvolved zones. In this context, <span

							</p>
							<p class='indent'>The DNP hyperpolarization procedure can be in
								principle applied to any molecule, provided that efficient
								methods for the rapid dissolution of the hyperpolarized
								substrate and the separation of the paramagnetic agent are
								available. Conversely, the use of the PHIP method requires
								hydrogenatable substrates, and implies the use of hydrogenation
								catalysts which must be removed before the in vivo
								administration. Its main advantage relies on the fact that it
								does not require the very low temperatures used in the DNP
								procedure, thus resulting in a simpler and cheaper methodology.
							</p>
							<p class='indent'>
								At CIM, the PHIP procedure is used to produce hyperpolarized
								molecules suitable as <sup>13</sup>C MRI contrast agents.
							</p>
							<p class='indent'>Three different areas of research are currently
								developed:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Preparation of novel substrates for para-hydrogenation</li>
								<li>Development of quick methods for the catalyst and organic
									solvent removal after para-hydrogenation</li>
								<li>Development of procedures to convert the <sup>13</sup>C
									anti-phase signal obtained after para-hydrogenation to in-phase
									signal (suitable for MRI)
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p class='indent'>
								<b>1. Novel substrates for para-hydrogenation.</b>
							</p>
							<p>Substrates must satisfy the following requisites:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>an unsaturated substrate is necessary (usually a triple bond
									containing molecule, that is efficiently para-hydrogenated in
									the presence of a suitable catalyst)</li>
								<li>a <sup class='superscript'>13</sup>C atom characterized by a
									long T <sub class='subscript'>1</sub>value (which allows to
									cope with the polarization loss due to relaxation), must be
									adjacent to the unsaturation in order to allow polarization
									transfer from para-hydrogen through scalar coupling
								</li>
								<li>The hydrogenation product must be water-soluble</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="indent">Some examples of substrates which have been
								developed:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><sup>13</sup>C-enriched unsaturated derivatives of glucose</li>
								<li><sup>15</sup>N-enriched unsaturated derivatives of choline</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="indent">
								Among the <sup>13</sup>C hyperpolarized substrates that have
								been used for in-vivo studies, pyruvate is the most widely
								exploited for the investigation of pathologies. Since a
								de-hydrogenated precursor of pyruvate does not exist, a method
								named <b>PHIP-SAH</b> (PHIP-Side Arm Hydrogenation) has been
								developed in our laboratories that allows to obtain this HP
								metabolite through the following passages: 1) functionalization
								of the carboxylic group with an unsaturated alcohol (the
								Side-Arm); 2) hydrogenation of th e double-triple bond using
								parahydrogen; 3) spin order transfer from the parahydrogen
								protons to the 13C carboxylate nucleus (Magnetic Field Cycle);
								4) cleavage of the hydrogenated side-arm by means of hydrolysis.
								Hydrogenation is carried out in an organic, hydrophobic solvent
								and the HP metabolite is extracted in the aqueous phase,
								according to the phase transfer method (see the following
								section). The PHIP-SAH strategy can be applied to other
								metabolites (e.g. lactate, acetate, ..) and, in principle, to
								all the molecules containing a carboxylic group.

								<b>2. Quick methods for the catalyst and organic solvent removal
									after para-hydrogenation</b>
							</p>
							Para-hydrogenation reactions are usually carried out in organic
							solvent solutions, by using Rh cationic complexes as catalysts.
							Both the solvent and the catalyst are toxic and must be removed
							before injection of the HP product. This can be achieved by:
							<p class='indent'>a) Ion exchange chromatography and spray
								distillation</p>
							<p class='indent'>b) Phase transfer</p>
							<p class='indent'>c) use of water-soluble catalysts and ion
								exchange chromatography</p>
							<p class='indent'>All the three possibilities are studied at the
								CIM.</p>
							<p class='indent'>The second methodology is of particular
								interest because it allows to carry out the para-hydrogenation
								in organic solvents (where its efficiency is higher), and then
								to remove catalyst, solvent and unreacted substrate in one step
								only by phase transfer, yielding ready-to-use pure water
								solutions of the HP product. It is possible to use a lypophilic
								unsaturated precursor, which is quickly converted after
								para-hydrogenation into a water-soluble compound of interest by
								addition of an aqueous phase, in which it is immediately
								extracted. By this route, hyperpolarized succinate has been
								produced by para-hydrogenation of maleic anhydride in chloroform
								and subsequent hydrolysis.</p>
							<p class='indent'>
								<b>3. Transfer of parahydrogen spin order to <sup>13</sup>C net
									polarization.
								</b>
							</p>
							Spin order must be transferred from para-hydrogen protons to
							heteronuclei, in order to obtain heteronuclear net polarization
							that can be used for the acquisition of MR mages. This can be
							achieved by application of an opportune magnetic field cycle
							(MFC) or by the use of pulse sequences. The first method is
							currently exploited in the CIM laboratories. A dedicated set-up
							has been built by Aspect Imaging and it consists in a magnetic
							field shield (three concentric cylinders made of mu-metal)
							bearing a solenoid coil that is supplied with electric current
							controlled with a custom-written function. This allows to carry
							out MFC in a completely controlled manner.
