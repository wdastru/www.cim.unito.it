							Bacterial infections cause significant mortality and morbidity
							worldwide despite the availability of antibiotic. Sepsis is a
							serious medical condition characterized by deregulated systemic
							inflammatory response followed by immunosuppression (Cohen J et
							al. Lancet Infect Dis 2015; 15:581). Epidemiological records from
							USA show and incidence of sepsis of 3 cases per 1,000 persons
							annually. More than 30 million cases of sepsis worldwide per
							annum are estimated and despite advances in supportive care,
							sepsis remains associated with very high mortality rates (40-60%)
							(Fleischmann C et al. Am J RespirCrit Care Med 2016; 193:259;
							Soteller J, et al. J Crit Care 2016; 31:58). Sepsis may be caused
							by Gram-positive, Gram-negative and polymicrobial infection.
							Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia are
							Gram-positive isolates, whereas Escherichia coli,
							Klebsiellaspecies and Pseudomonasaeruginosa predominates among
							Gram-negative isolates (Annane D et al. Lancet 2005; 365:63).
							Blood culture diagnosis of infection is the current standard for
							sepsis. However, positive cultures can be detected in only 20% of
							sepsis patients. Consequently, bacterial infections can be
							diagnosed only after they caused significant anatomical tissue
							damage, a stage at which they are challenging to treat owing to
							the high bacterial burden. <br> As human life expectancy
							continues to increase, so has the number of frail and
							immune-compromised individuals who are susceptible to bacterial
							infections. A major contributor to this trend is the
							proliferation of medical implants and devices, which are
							inherently vulnerable to bacterial contamination. <br> A major
							challenge in averting biomaterial-associated infections and
							sepsis is the lack of a sensitive, specific non- invasive
							modality to detect early-stage bacterial infections, when
							treatment is most effective owing to the absence of profound
							biofilm formation. <br> Currently, only indirect imaging
							modalities are in clinical use, as exemplified by PET with
							fluoro-deoxy glucose, which visualizes increased glucose uptake
							by inflammatory cells (Love C. et al. Radiographics 2005;
							25:1357). Unfortunately, these approaches lack sufficient
							resolution, practicality and cannot clearly discriminate between
							active bacterial infection from other pathologies such as cancer
							and general inflammation. Therefore, clinical imaging tools that
							are easy to use, allow bedside monitoring, and directly target
							invasive bacteria are highly desirable. <br> <br> The purpose of
							our unit is to develop smart-activatable probes to target
							bacteria with a MRI contrast agent. Particularly we are
							interesting and to explore the use of Gd complex labeled
							vancomycin to specifically target and detect Gram positive
							bacteria andGd-conjugated to maltohexaose, as sugar that is
							rapidly internalized through the bacteria specific maltodextrin
							transport pathway (Boss w. et al. MicrobiolMolBiol Rev 1998;
							62:204) in biofilms generated in vitro (Jurciseck JA et al Jove
							2011; 47:1) infections as well as in the cecal ligation and
							puncture model of murine sepsis (Dejager L et al Trends in
							Microbiology 2011; 19:198).
