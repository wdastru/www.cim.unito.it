<p class='indent'>The MRI responsive agents are substances whose
relaxivity depends on a particular physiological parameter of the
microenvironment in which they are distributed (pH, temperature,
enzymatic activity, ... ). Their application could give rise to the
formation of images whose contrast depends on the particular value
of the physiological parameter. The crucial problem to be solved is
to be sure that the differences in the relaxation are due to
changes of the relaxivity instead of the concentration of the
agent.<br />
Two main approaches are followed:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>pH responsive agents</b><br />
<p class="indent">They are agents based on DOTA-type Gd complexes
in which the fourth arm is presenting a sulphonamidic function. The
pK <sub>a</sub>of the N-H bond in such groups can be modified
around the physiological values via suitable substitutions. The
deprotonation of the N-H permits the entrance of the nitrogen atom
into the coordination sphere of the complex, eventually changing
its relaxivity. By comparing the T <sub>1</sub>values obtained
using two complexes that differ only in the pK <sub>a</sub>is
possible to obtain a pH map. The assumption is that the two
complexes show the same biodistribution.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Dual agents MRI/PET or SPECT</b><br />
<p class="indent">The concentration of the agent is obtained via
PET or SPECT. Two routes are explored:</p>
<ul>
<li>The MRI complex has the same biodistribution of the PET/SPECT
agent. Such approach is exploited on DOTA-type complexes by
changing the metal for each different technique: for MRI the metal
is Gd, in PET experiments the &beta;-emitting <sup>68</sup>Ga is
used while <sup>166</sup>Ho is the metal for SPECT. While Gd and Ho
complexes probably share the same biodistribution, the same could
not be said for the Ga complex (same charge of the ion, but
different coordination capability).</li>
<li>The PET/SPECT reporter is covalently linked to the Gd complex.
In this situation the dual agent contains both the MRI and
PET/SPECT probes. The latter is mainly in his 'cold' form, the
relative quantity of the 'hot' one depends both on the modality
used and the characteristics of the isotope itself. Knowing the
stoichiometric ratio between the radioactive isotope and the Gd is
possible to extract the concentration of the agent, and transform
the observed relaxation rates into pH maps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
