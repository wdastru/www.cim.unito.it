<p class="indent">The possibility to guide a therapeutic treatment
with imaging is an extremely interesting opportunity. A really
important advance in this field was represented by the advent of
MRI tomographs coupled with high frequency ultrasound systems for
iperthermia localized treatments. Our activities in the files
are:</p>
<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Drug releasing liposomes</b>
<p class='indent'>Liposomes loaded with both MRI contrast agents
and drug molecules are used. They are administered to model animals
and their MRI visualization permits to quantify the number of
liposomes (hence drug molecules) that are present at the site of
interest. The liposomes are engineered in order to release
(possibly triggered) the drug and the contrast agent. The liposomes
could be further engineered in order to be a reporter of the
therapeutic efficacy of the drug. To reach this goal, both Gd and
CEST MRI probes will be used.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Neutron Capture Therapy and Imaging</b>
<p class='indent'>The Neutron Capture Therapy (NCT) approach is of
great interest mostly for brain tumors, and is based on the ability
of a number of nuclei (among them <sup>10</sup>B) to absorb
neutrons to start a nuclear reaction that causes the destruction of
the cells. The success of the treatment is dependent on the
quantity of active compound that reaches the ill cell, with respect
to the quantity that distributes among vases and healthy cells. To
this goal B and Gd containing probes are synthesized; from the MRI
images it is possible to know the concentration of Gd and then
calculate that of B. The probes contain carboranes, Gd complexes
and a vector to drive them to the target of interest. It is worth
noting that Gd exists in a form ( <sup>157</sup>Gd) that is
sensible to neutron capture, and its presence in the probe
represents a strengthening of the therapeutic action.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Controlled Gd release systems</b>
<p class='indent'>It is well known that the free Gd
<sup>3+</sup>ion is really toxic; for this reason, it is used in
the MRI applications only complexed in extremely stable compounds.
This line of activity exploits the cytotoxicity of Gd
<sup>3+</sup>by allowing the ion to be released in a controlled way
at the site of interest. We are now considering probes that can
recognise targets on the tumoral cells and then release the Gd
<sup>3+</sup>inside the cell. In order to reduce the systemic
toxicity of the metal ion, the probe is engineered to be
deactivated (with respect to the release of Gd <sup>3+</sup>)
shortly after reaching its target.</p>
</li>
