<p class='indent'>The development of efficient procedure for
Molecular Imaging needs high affinity and sensitivity probes. This
topic is the main activity for the development of innovative
dignostics.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The fibrin target</b><br />
<p class="indent">We are working on a system made of a peptide and
four Gd complexes and trying to optimize both the binding affinity
and the contrast it induces in the MRI images. A number of diseases
inveriably show the presence of fibrin deposits (tumours, plaques,
trombi ...). The development of an efficient system for spotting
these deposits could represent a "one-stop-shop-agent" that could
be used for different applications.</p>
</li>
<li><b>The XIII factor target</b><br />
<p class="indent">A previous work permitted us to identify a
peptide which is an optimal substrate for such enzime, and give
rise to its fast inclusion in the matrix of a forming trombus. This
peptide could be functionalized with one or more units of
Gd-chelate in order to obtain a forming-trombus reporter.</p>
</li>
<li><b>The -SH target</b><br />
<p class="indent">The easy oxidation of the thiolic function
represent an excellent indicator of the redox state of the
biological microenvironment. Furthermore, the presence of exposed
SH groups could be the result of mutations and subsequent
conformational variations associated to important diseases
(PPL/multiple sclerosis). For these reasons we are optimizing a
probe able to specifically bind to free thiols. their quantitation
could have interesting diagnostic implications.</p>
</li>
<li><b>The MMPs target</b><br />
<p class="indent">The Matrix Metallo Proteases are enzimes that are
present in a number of tissutal remodeling situations and represent
important indicators of diseases (tumours, multiple sclerosis,
atherosclerotic plaques). The probe is represented by insoluble
particles that could be solubilized in presence of the enzime; by
this way they transform from a T2* into a T1 agent. The
insolubility is due to the presence of a lipophilic chain that is
separated from the Gd complex by a suitable spacer that could be
cleaved by the MMPs. The particles are made of aggregates of Gd
complexes, cyclodextrins, aggregating and driving agents (agents
that have the role of driving the particles to the site of
interest).</p>
