								<h3 font style="text-transform: none;">Development of protein binders by mirror-image phage display peptide library screening</h3>
								
								<p align="justify">Mirror-image phage display peptide library screening is a methodology to find metabolically stable 
								D-peptides as protein binders. First, the target protein is synthesized by native chemical ligation as all-D isoform, 
								then a phage display peptide library is screened against the D-protein to find L-peptide binders. For symmetry, the 
								corresponding D-peptides will bind the natural protein target. In this way, a metabolically stable peptide binder can 
								be developed. Crucial to this approach is the ability to synthesize by native chemical ligation the D-protein.

										</header>
										<img src="<?php echo $localizer; ?>/PI/DAndrea/images/research_1_1.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">

										<p align="justify">
										Axl is a tyrosine kinases receptor playing crucial role in several cellular responses. Axl/Gas6 signaling has been 
										demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of the multiple sclerosis (MS). In fact, oligodendrocytes (ODs) 
										apoptosis is one of the features characterizing newly-forming myelin lesions in MS patients. Axl/Gas6 system is 
										known to promote ODs maturation and survival and, thus, the down-regulation of Axl/Gas6 signaling observed in MS 
										lesion contributes to disease progression. The selection of new molecules targeting and activating Axl receptor and 
										thus able to restore the physiological homeostasis of Gas6/Axl system in MS patients represents a potential strategy 
										for preventing or ameliorating demyelination in MS. This activity aims to find novel peptide molecules able to activate 
										Axl receptor in order to induce ODs survival and axon remyelination. We focus on Ig2 domain of Axl, one of the key 
										extracellular regions of the receptor involved in ligand binding. The protein was synthesized in its D-enantiomeric 
										form (D-Axl-2), opening the way to the selection of D-peptides selectively targeting Axl receptor through the mirror-image 
										phage display peptide library screening approach

											<p font style="text-transform: none; font-size:1.3em">Peptide-based molecular imaging probes targeting Axl receptor as biomarker for the early detection of drug resistances in cancer</p>
										</header>

										<p align="justify">
										Axl receptor and its ligand Gas6 were demonstrated to be overexpressed in different human cancers, providing a pro-survival advantage,
										 inducing proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and, additionally, allowing the generation of an immunosuppressed microenvironment. 
										 Axl expression has been associated with acquired resistance to conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapy and its upregulation 
										 has been correlated with poor prognosis, increased invasiveness/metastasis and development of drug resistance in several tumors. 
										 These data suggest that Axl receptor is an effective target for cancer diagnosis and has also a prognostic value. Axl imaging may 
										 aid in the clinical follow-up of cancer patients, predicting when the first-line treatment starts to became ineffective due to the
										  development of resistance. We intend to develop peptide-based molecules targeting Axl receptors, with high specificity and affinity 
										  and with high serum stability, using the mirror-image phage display peptide library screening. Such peptide molecules will be suitably 
										  functionalized with tracers to obtain molecular probes for Axl imaging using PET/MRI and optical imaging techniques. We focus on 
										  fibronectin-like extracellular domains of Axl which will be prepared by recombinant DNA technology (L-form) and by chemical synthesis (D-form).
