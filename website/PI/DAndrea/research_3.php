								<h3 font style="text-transform: none;">Design and synthesis of VEGF/VEGF receptors targeting compounds</h3>
								
								<p align="justify">The Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is the main regulator of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, 
								both in physiological and in pathological conditions. VEGF exerts its biological function through the interaction with three 
								tyrosine kinase receptors: VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. VEGFR1 and 2 are the principal drivers of physiological and pathological
								 angiogenesis. The deregulation of the VEGF/VEGFR biological axis is correlated to the onset of several common human diseases. 
								 For instance, a pathological hypervascularization is observed in cancer, in ocular degenerative diseases and in chronic inflammations, 
								 while a defective angiogenesis is associated to ischemic and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the development of both anti-angiogenic and 
								 pro-angiogenic drugs gained prominent attention from scientists. Furthermore, VEGF and VEGFRs targeting molecules have also been proposed 
								 as imaging agents. Starting from the crystal structure of the complex between VEGF and its receptor, we designed and characterized a 
								 series of mimetic peptides reproducing epitopes of the interacting surface of VEGF with its receptor. These new molecules are useful 
								 molecular tools able to modulate angiogenesis. We obtained bioactive peptides, targeting VEGFRs, with VEGF agonist or antagonist properties, 
								 and thus finding complementary applications in biomedicine.

										</header>
										
										<p align="justify">
										This class of peptides was designed on the N-terminal &alpha;-helix (residues 17-25) of VEGF. The most promising peptide was identified 
										in peptide QK 
										<a class="html" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16186493"
												target="_blank"><font color="blue">[D’Andrea et al 2005]</font></a>. 
										In solution QK assumes a well-defined &alpha;-helical 
										structure. It shows an unusual thermodynamic helix stability. Spectroscopic studies revealed that at 70°C QK retains about the 80% 
										of its room temperature helical content. Two elements play a relevant role in stabilizing QK helical conformation: the residues located 
										at the N-terminal region and Leu7 and Leu10, which make a network of stabilizing hydrophobic contacts. We revealed the molecular details 
										of the interaction between peptide QK and its receptor in vitro and in presence of endothelial cells using NMR spectroscopy 
										<a class="html" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/chem.201802117"
												target="_blank"><font color="blue">[Di Stasi et al 2018]</font></a>. 
										Peptide QK has a biological profile similar to VEGF as shown by in vitro and in vivo analyses.
										Peptide QK can exert its biological activity also conjugated or trapped in biomaterials, expanding their biomedical potential, especially 
										in tissue engineering and tissue revascularization applications, where insufficient vascularization is a limiting factor

											<p font style="text-transform: none; font-size:1.3em">VEGFR targeting &beta;-hairpin peptides with proangiogenic activity</p>
										</header>

										<p align="justify">
										This class of peptides was designed to mimic the &beta;-hairpin region 79-93 of VEGF. We found that peptide HPLW showed an interesting 
										VEGF-like biological activity 
										<a class="html" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21969375"
												target="_blank"><font color="blue">[Diana et al 2011]</font></a>. 
										HPLW in solution is a monomer and assumes a stable 
										&beta;-hairpin structure as determined by NMR. The binding mode with VEGFRs was analyzed by NMR, either in vitro and in presence of 
										endothelial cells. 15N-edited NMR spectroscopic experiments demonstrate that an interaction between HPLW and VEGFR2 occurs on the 
										surface of ECs. Furthermore, competition experiments in presence of VEGF, confirmed the specificity of the interaction 
										<a class="html" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25378243"
												target="_blank"><font color="blue">[Diana et al 2015]</font></a>. 
										Finally, thermal folding pathway of HPLW was investigated combining DSC, NMR and MD simulation 
										<a class="html" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26602442"
												target="_blank"><font color="blue">[Diana et al 2015]</font></a>.
										The biological characterization showed that peptide HPLW is able to bind specifically VEGFRs on the 
										surface of ECs. Peptide binding to ECs induces VEGFR2 phosphorylation and activation of intracellular pathways correlated with EC survival 
										and proliferation. HPLW, as VEGF, is able to rescue ECs from apoptosis and induce proliferation. Finally, HPLW induces angiogenesis in mice 
										using an in vivo model of angiogenesis. Overall, HPLW is a proangiogenic peptide which potential in therapeutic angiogenesis. 
										A novel protease-resistant HPLW analogue is in preparation.

											<p font style="text-transform: none; font-size:1.3em">VEGF/VEGFR targeting biomolecules with anti-angiogenic activity</p>
										</header>

										<p align="justify">
										We developed peptides and proteins able to interfere with the VEGF-VEGFR complex formation as potential anti-angiogenic agents. 
										We established a recombinant expression protocol for the preparation of the region 129-229 of VEGFR1 
										<a class="html" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bip.21448"
												target="_blank"><font color="blue">[Di Stasi et al 2010]</font></a>. 
										This region is the main recognition site for VEGF. The protein was expressed in good yield and it was correctly folded. A structural and biological 
										characterization showed that the protein is functional active. It binds to VEGF with a binding constant of 3 nM and it is able to inhibit EC 
										proliferation induced by VEGF. This small protein is an alternative to the high molecular weight neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies for imaging 
										and therapeutic applications. VEGFR peptide binders were also found with anti-angiogenic activity. A 15mer helical peptide was found to block 
										VEGF effect on ECs, as well as angiogenesis and tumor progression in vivo 
										<a class="html" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21280635"
												target="_blank"><font color="blue">[Basile et al 2011]</font></a>.
										We showed that this peptide 
										binds to VEGFR2 inhibiting VEGF-dependent VEGFR2 activation, blocking EC intracellular pathways, VEGF survival activity and EC proliferation. 
										In vivo, it reduces the VEGF-dependent angiogenesis and the growth of melanoma in a xenograft model in mice. The reduction of tumor size correlates 
										with the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. This peptide is a candidate for the development of novel peptide-based drugs for the treatment of diseases 
										associated with excessive angiogenesis.
