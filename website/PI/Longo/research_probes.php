								<h3 font style="text-transform: none;">Development of
									high-relaxivity Gd-based and responsive CEST contrast agents</h3>
									
								<p align="justify">MRI-based contrast agents are often required in order to improve the diagnostic content of the tomographic image.
								Currently used small molecular weigth Gd-complexes, optimized for the clinical scenario, have been used in pre-clinical settings to report on 
								vessel architecture and on <a href="<?php echo $localizer; ?>PI/Longo/research_angiogenesis.php"><font color="blue">tumor vessel permeability</font></a>. 
								Such Gd-based complexes have, unfortunately, sub-optimal contrast properties 
								when used with low-field (1 Tesla) pre-clinical MRI scanners in addition to sub-optimal binding properties to mouse serum albumin.
								<br>
								Despite Gd-based agents are an indispensable part of MRI examinations, in the past decades, two major clinical studies questioned their safety profiles 
								and alternatives to Gd-based agents are not readily available. Our lab discovered that Iodinated contrast media, playing a key-role in oncological
								imaging can provide contrast enhancement in tumors (by exploiting the MRI-CEST approach) that is correlated with corresponding CT enhanced images.
								In addition, we have demosntrated that most of them can be exploited as <a href="<?php echo $localizer; ?>PI/Longo/research_acidosis.php"><font color="blue">pH-responsive contrast agents</font></a>.
								
								
								<br/>
								<strong>We are interested in developing novel blood-pool Gd-based and CEST-based contrast agents with a focus for preclinical imaging applications.
								In addition, we are exploring radiographic contrast media as novel MRI contrast agents for assessing tumor perfusion and acidosis.</strong></p>

											Gd-based agents are an indispensable part of MRI examinations

											Iodinated contrast media (CM) are commonly used x-ray contrast agents, playing a

											in tumors (by exploiting the MRI-CEST approach) that is
											correlated with corresponding CT enhanced images. In
											addition, both iodinated and Gd-based CM have similar
											molecular weights, likely possessing similar tumor perfusion
											properties. We demonstrated that iodinated CM can provide MR enhanced-tumor images and
											perfusion values comparable to that provided by a Gd-based contrast agent

											iodinated CM and a Gd-based agent in a preclinical breast

											MRI-CEST approach, might be able to replace Gd-based agents.</p>

											<br>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
										Responsive agents capable of reporting physicochemical properties of diagnostic interest 
										of the microenvironment in which they distribute (such as pH, temperature, metabolites,..) 
										require multiple magnetically non-equivalent protons in order to apply a ratiometric approach to rule out the concentration term.
										We have proposed a novel ratiometric pH MRI method based on the analysis of CEST effects under different radio
										frequency irradiation power levels to a CEST molecule possessing a single proton pool. 
										We demonstrated that the proposed RF power-based ratiometric pH MRI method extends conventional ratiometric pH MRI to CEST agents
										with at least one exchangeable site, with enhanced pH sensitivity
											
											<a class="html" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25238643"

										<img src="<?php echo $localizer; ?>PI/Longo/images/probes5.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">										
										
										<p align="justify">
										All these ratiometric methods have been demonstrated by using a continuous wave saturation scheme
										that limits its translation to clinical scanners. We have developed a new ratiometric CEST-MRI pH-mapping approach
										based on a pulsed CEST saturation scheme for a radiographic contrast agent (iodixanol) possessing a single chemical exchange
										site. This approach is based on the ratio of the CEST contrast effects at two different flip angles combinations
										(180/360 and 180/720), keeping constant the mean irradiation RF power (Bavg power). The proposed ratiometric approach index 
										is concentration independent and it showed good pH sensitivity and accuracy in the physiological range between 6.0 and 7.4
