								<h3 font style="text-transform: none;">Imaging renal pH</h3>
								<p align="justify">
									The kidney is a highly complex organ consisting of welldefined
									structures that function in a deeply coordinate
									fashion to allow for fine regulation of pH homeostasis.
									The role of the kidney in acid-base balance depends
									on the capacity of the renal tubule to reclaim filtered
									bicarbonate and to excrete net protons as titratable acids
									and ammonium.</br>
									Although the principal role of the kidney is the maintenance of
									acid–base balance, current imaging approaches are unable to
									assess this important parameter and clinical biomarkers are not
									robust enough in evaluating the severity of kidney damage.
									Therefore, our lab is developing novel noninvasive imaging approaches
									to assess the acid–base homeostasis in vivo and to monitor pH evolution following kidney injury. 
									Our lab is also actively involved in the <b>COST Action "PARENCHIMA"</b> 
									<a	href="http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ca/CA16103"

									(Magnetic Resonance Imaging Biomarkers for Chronic Kidney
									Disease).<br><strong> We aim to demonstrate the biological validity
									of renal pH imaging as a novel biomarker of kidney diseases.</strong>

											multiple ischemic, toxic, and obstructive tubular insults

											necrosis that occurs in humans. According to the
											elicited damage, this model shows an inherent capability
											to recover from the damage, therefore allowing to image
											pH variations both at the acute stage of the injury and
											during the recovery period. We observed an increase
											of pH levels reaching a peak at day 3 that correlates well
											with the corresponding BUN raise and a complete recovery 21 days following the damage

											a suitable method for the noninvasive and longitudinal
											investigation of renal injury and may provide useful
											insight on monitoring functional recovery. Moreover, the
											proposed method provides spatial information on single
											kidney function and integrity, and not just an average of
											the kidneys’ functionality as with clinical biomarker
											such as serum creatinine and BUN.</p>

											Ischemic renal injury is a severe clinical problem in nephrology and the
											major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). We investigated whether MRI-CEST renal pH mapping
											can detect early renal damage and distinguish AKI recovery from irreversible damage
											in a unilateral kidney ischemia reperfusion injury (KIRI) model. The advantage of this model is that 
											only one kidney is damaged, whereas the contralateral kidney is not affected. Consequently, 
											in this model of post-ischemic AKI, serum biomarkers are minimally affected, since the contralateral
											kidney can compensate for the reduced renal functionality.
											We shown that MRI-CEST pH mapping can detect the early onset of acute
											kidney damage and distinguish between the recovery and persistence
											of the damage following unilateral ischemia reperfusion injury in mice.
										<a class="html" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28370530" target="_blank"><font color="blue">[Longo et al. 2017]</font></a>.
											Morover, MRI-CEST renal pH values were significantly correlated
											with histological scores, reflecting renal damage.

										<p align="justify">The results reported herein show, for the first time, that MRI-CEST
											pH mapping allows the noninvasive detection and monitoring of
											renal function impairment after unilateral ischemia-induced AKI.
											The derangement of pH regulation was correlated to the decay
											of renal filtration function and to the severity of the morphological
											damage.</p>
