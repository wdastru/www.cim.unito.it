										</header>
										

										<p align="justify">
											Polylactic and glycolic acid nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs), coated with L-ferritin, 
											are exploited for the simultaneous delivery of paclitaxel and an amphiphilic Gd based MRI 
											contrast agent into breast cancer cells (MCF7). L-ferritin has been covalently conjugated 
											to the external surface of PLGA-NPs exploiting NHS activated carboxylic groups.												
											<img src="<?php echo $localizer; ?>PI/Geninatti/images/figureresearch41.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming"> 
											The results confirmed that nanoparticles decorated with L-ferritin have many advantages with 
											respect to both albumin-decorated and nondecorated particles. Ferritin moieties endow PLGA-NPs 
											with targeting capability, exploiting SCARA5 receptors overexpressed by these tumor cells, that 
											results in an increased paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Moreover, protein coating increased nanoparticle 
											stability, thus reducing the fast and aspecific drug release before reaching the target. The theranostic 
											potential of the nanoparticles has been demonstrated by evaluating the signal intensity enhancement on 
											T1-weighted MRI images of labeled MCF7 cells. The results were compared with that obtained with MDA cells 
											used as negative control due to their lower SCARA5 expression.

										<p align="justify">
											Quantitative measurement of marker expression in diseased cells is still a topic of considerable interest
											 and different methodologies are currently under intense scrutiny. This work aims at developing an in vitro 
											 diagnostic method based on the release of paramagnetic species from relaxometrically â€œsilentâ€� liposomes
											  operated by the action of a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) previously targeted to the epitope of interest. 
											  The released paramagnetic species causes an increase of the longitudinal water proton relaxation rate 
											  proportional to the number of PLA2 bound to the cell outer surface.

											Cell Adhesion Moleculeâ€“Targeted Doxorubicin- Containing Liposomes in Experimentally Induced Kaposi's Sarcoma</p>
											<br>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">
										The aim of the present study was to investigate whether neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)â€“targeted liposomes 
										may enhance drug delivery and allow MRI in a severe combined immunodeficient mouse model of NCAM-positive Kaposi's 
										sarcoma. NCAM-binding peptideâ€“coated liposomes loaded with both doxorubicin and a lipophilic gadolinium (Gd) 
										derivative were generated. NCAM-targeted liposomes induced an enhanced in vitro doxorubicin internalization within 
										Kaposi's cells as detected by MRI with respect to untargeted polyethylene glycol liposomes. Internalization resulted 
										in enhanced apoptosis. In vivo weekly administration of NCAM-targeted liposomes induced a significant reduction of tumor 
										mass and vascularization and enhanced cell necrosis and apoptosis with respect to untargeted liposomes. 
										These effects were associated with an enhanced concentration of doxorubicin within the tumor and a reduced systemic 
										toxicity of doxorubicin. By electron microscopy, NCAM-targeted liposomes were detected mainly within tumor cells whereas the 
										untargeted liposomes were mainly accumulated in the extracellular space.				</p>
										
										<img src="<?php echo $localizer; ?>PI/Geninatti/images/figureresearch45.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">										
										
										<p align="justify">
										In conclusion, targeting NCAM may be a suitable strategy for specific drug delivery and imaging by liposomes in NCAM-expressing tumors.</p>
