									<p style="text-align: justify;">This study aims at developing
										an innovative theranostic approach for lung tumor and
										metastases treatment, based on Boron Neutron Capture Therapy
										(BNCT). It relies on to the use of low density lipoproteins
										(LDL) as carriers able to maximize the selective uptake of
										boron atoms in tumor cells and, at the same time, to quantify
										the in vivo boron distribution by magnetic resonance imaging
										(MRI). Tumor cells uptake was initially assessed by ICP-MS and
										MRI on four types of tumor (TUBO, B16-F10, MCF-7, A549) and
										one healthy (N-MUG) cell lines. Lung metastases were generated
										by intravenous injection of a Her2+ breast cancer cell line
										(i.e. TUBO) in BALB/c mice and transgenic EML4-ALK mice were
										used as primary tumor model. After neutron irradiation, tumor
										growth was followed for 30-40 days by MRI. Tumor masses of
										boron treated mice increased markedly slowly than the control
										group.</p>

											for Combined Cancer Therapy by Folate Receptor Targeting.</span>
									</h3>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">The combination of different
										therapeutic modalities is a promising option to combat the
										recurrence of tumors. In this study, polylactic and
										polyglycolic acid nanoparticles were used for the simultaneous
										delivery of a boron–curcumin complex (RbCur) and an
										amphiphilic gadolinium complex into tumor cells with the aim
										of performing boron and gadolinium neutron capture therapy
										(NCT) in conjunction with the additional antiproliferative
										effects of curcumin. Furthermore, the use of Gd complexes
										allows magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of the
										amount of B and Gd internalized by tumor cells.
										Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles were
										targeted to ovarian cancer (IGROV-1) cells through folate
										receptors, by including in the formulation a PEGylated
										phospholipid functionalized with the folate moiety.</p>
									<!--<img src="images/figureresearch22.jpg" alt="figure 4"
										class="image zooming">-->
									<p style="text-align: justify;">NCT was performed on IGROV-1
										cells internalizing 6.4 and 78.6 mgg1 of 10B and 157Gd,
										respectively. The synergic action of neutron treatment and
										curcumin cytotoxicity was shown to result in a significant
										therapeutic improvement.</p>

										<span style="text-transform: none;">Synthesis
											of a carborane-containing cholesterol derivative and
											evaluation as a potential dual agent for MRI/BNCT
											applications.</span>
									</h3>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										In this study the synthesis and characterization of a new
										dual, imaging and therapeutic, agent is proposed with the aim
										of improving the efficacy of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy
										(BNCT) in cancer treatment. The agent (Gd-B-AC01) consists of
										a carborane unit (ten boron atoms) bearing a cholesterol unit
										on one side (to pursue the incorporation into the liposome
										bi-layer) and a Gd(III)/1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane
										monoamide complex on the other side (as a MRI reporter to
										attain the quantification of the B/Gd concentration). In order
										to endow the BNCT agent with specific delivery properties, the
										liposome embedded with the MRI/BNCT dual probes has been
										functionalized with a pegylated phospholipid containing a
										folic acid residue at the end of the PEG chain. The vector
										allows the binding of the liposome to folate receptors that
										are overexpressed in many tumor types, and in particular, in
										human ovarian cancer cells (IGROV-1). <img
											src="images/figureresearch23.jpg" alt="figure 5"
											class="image zooming">
									</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">An in vitro test on IGROV-1
										cells demonstrated that Gd-B-AC01 loaded liposomes are
										efficient carriers for the delivery of the MRI/BNCT probes to
										the tumor cells. Finally, the BNCT treatment of IGROV-1 cells
										showed that the number of surviving cells was markedly smaller
										when the cells were irradiated after internalization of the
										folate-targeted GdB10-AC01/liposomes.</p>
