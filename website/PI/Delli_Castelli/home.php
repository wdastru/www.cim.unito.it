											<b>Molecular Imaging is a cutting-edge medical technique that
												enables the visualization and analysis of biological
												processes at molecular and cellular levels within living
												organisms. The main imaging technologies that are used to
												this purpose, at clinical or preclinical level, are:
												positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission
												computed tomography (SPECT), optical Imaging (OI), computed
												tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Each
												of these techniques exhibits weaknesses and strengths for
												these applications. For instance, PET is the most sensitive
												among the imaging techniques but employs radiotracers and
												has low spatial resolution. Optical imaging is highly
												sensitive and minimally invasive, but it is limited in
												tissue penetration capability. MRI provides highly detailed
												anatomical information with good sensitivity, although much
												lower compared to PET and optical imaging. For these
												reasons, quite often, these techniques work in synergy
												taking advantage of hybrid instruments. Molecular Imaging
												approach holds immense promise in various fields, including
												oncology, neurology, cardiology, and immunology, as it
												provides insights into disease progression, early detection,
												and treatment response assessment. The combination of
												advanced imaging technologies with targeted molecular probes
												empowers scientists to unravel the intricacies of complex
												biological processes, leading to enhanced diagnostic
												accuracy and to the development of personalized therapeutic
												strategies. The research activity of Prof. Delli Castelli
												and her team belong to this broader area of Molecular
												Imaging. In particular, in the last years, they have
												contributed to the advancement of research in the field of
												contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging for molecular
												targeting and metabolic imaging applications. Within the
												array of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents, this
												group has specialized in advancing a relatively emerging
												category referred to as Chemical Exchange Saturation
												Transfer (CEST) contrast agents. The distinctiveness of
												these contrast agents, as opposed to conventional
												gadolinium-based ones, lies in their capability to
												simultaneously visualize multiple entities within a single
												image. This unique feature allows the visualization of
												multiple epitopes simultaneously in molecular targeting
												experiments or the visualization of more than one cellular
												population in cell tracking applications. Such
												implementation cannot be achieved in MRI using conventional
												gadolinium-based agents since the response these molecules
												induce in the system is undistinguishable from one molecule
												to another, leading to a reduction in bulk water relaxation
												time. In contrast, CEST agents provide the opportunity to
												introduce a frequency-encoded contrast, capitalizing on the
												distinct chemical shifts of the molecules under observation
												like in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS); however,
												CEST-MRI enhance the detection sensitivity through the
												indirect visualization of molecules at low concentration on
												the much more intense bulk water signal, resulting in an
												amplified response. Another distinct characteristic of this
												category of contrast agents, as opposed to conventional
												ones, is that CEST contrast can be easily modulated through
												tissue microenvironment parameters. Consequently, these
												molecules have proven to be excellent reporters of
												temperature, pH, redox potential, and catalytic activity.
												Despite these significant potentials, CEST contrast agents
												suffer from low sensitivity, a characteristic that the
												scientific community involved in their development has
												constantly addressed. One of the primary contribution of
												this research team regarding the sensitivity issue has
												focused on the development of nanosystems. These
												nanosystems, called LipoCEST have led to a remarkable
												increase in sensitivity by several orders of magnitude. This
												advancement has shifted the detection thresholds from
												millimolar concentrations to nanomolar concentrations, which
												are much more aligned with the purposes of molecular
												imaging. Due to the exceptional versatility of LipoCEST,
												these nanovesicles can be readily customized with molecular
												targeting vectors. Furthermore, these systems have been
												engineered to align themselves in a magnetic field
												accordingly with the sign of the magnetic susceptibility of
												their membrane thus altering the chemical shift (LIPO) of
												the mobile protons connected to these systems. This
												innovation facilitates the establishment of a library for
												multifaceted visualization (Fig. 1).<br> Regarding
												applications in metabolic imaging, the contribution of this
												research team has predominantly revolved around the
												advancement of pH-responsive probes, particularly involving
												paramagnetic molecules (ParaCEST agents). One of the most
												intriguing ParaCEST agents that has been developed is the
												YbHPDO3A complex. In solution, this probe exists as two
												isomers in slow exchange on the NMR timescale. This unique
												characteristic permits the visualization of two distinct
												signals deriving from the –OH protons of the two distinct
												isomers (SAP and TSAP). Fortunately, these two hydroxyl
												protons exhibit different CEST responses with respect to pH
												variations, allowing for a ratiometric approach to determine
												pH independently from the total probe concentration (which
												in vivo remains unknown). Figure 2 illustrates the pH map of
												the tumor microenvironment within a melanoma mouse model,
												obtained using the YbHPDO3A probe. The probe prove to be
												sensitive in the physio-pathological pH range.<br> In
												parallel with the research in the CEST field, this team has
												recently exploited their expertise in nanosystems to
												contribute to in vitro diagnostic test development. One
												example is reported in Fig.3 where a schematic
												representation of an alternative to the ELISA test (named
												LICIA, LipHosome Congiugated Immunoassorbent Assay) based on
												the use of liposomes able to change the pH in their
												environment following their dissembling is reported. The
												developed reporting systems for ligand/antiligand assays
												based on pH variations have been called LipHosomes. These
												tests have shown a strong competitive edge, particularly in
												cost effectiveness, when compared to the ELISA counterparts.<br>
												<h1>Future research plans</h1>At the moment, this research
												team is focusing its attention on the development of
												heteronuclear CEST agents. Utilizing heteronuclei could lead
												to a reduction in sensitivity threshold; however, it might
												come at the cost of compromising spatial resolution. This
												represents a groundbreaking initiative that has not been
												attempted before, paving the way for an entirely novel field
												of research. The goal is to optimize the parameters of
												heteronuclear CEST to expand the boundaries of diagnostic
												potential in CEST-MRI. The primary focus of our efforts will
												be directed towards the development of probes and pulse
												sequences, all aimed at successfully attaining this
												particular objective.
