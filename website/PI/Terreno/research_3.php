							<p style="text-align: justify;">
								Tracking cells in vivo by using imaging approaches represents a
								reliable method to assess the characteristics of cell grafts and
								to monitor their fate after transplantation. In that respect,
								minimally invasive techniques with high spatial resolution are
								desirable with a view of implementing therapeutic protocols in
								the clinical ordinary. MRI is a leading imaging modality
								enabling the non-invasive visualization of cell populations and
								their movements after transplantation in living animals with
								superb resolution. In order to be detectable, cells require to
								be adequately labelled with MRI contrast agents (CAs). Due to
								their excellent imaging efficiency, the superparamagnetic iron
								oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are regarded as the gold standard
								in cell-labeling. However, some issues are associated with their
								contrast generation mechanism based on signal-loss (negative
								contrast). As a promising alternative, paramagnetic CAs based on
								the metal Gadolinium (Gd) create a contrast increment (positive
								contrast) in T<sub>1</sub>-weighted (T<sub>1w</sub>) images,
								overcoming several complications related to the use of SPIONs.
								Even if toxic in the form of free aqueous ion, Gadolinium is
								generally considered safe when administered as a macrocyclic
								chelate and several agents have been approved for the clinical
								use so far. Differently from magnetic nanoparticles, large
								amounts of paramagnetic small molecules have to be delivered to
								target sites in order to be detected, and several labeling
								procedures have been developed to achieve this goal. In addition
								to Gd(III)-complexes, also fluorinated nanoparticles represent a
								valuable option for cellular imaging, especially for the
								visualization of the macrophage recruitment in inflammation
								sites or to tracking dendritic cells. One of the advantages of <sup>19</sup>F-MRI
								is the possibility to quantify the signal and calculate the
								cellular content in the site of interest. Besides MRI, other
								imaging modalities can be used for tracking cells in vivo, like
								optical or photoacoustic imaging.

								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									The same model has been also used to assess the macrophagic
									infiltrate after the onset of the lesion (Garello F. et al,
									manuscript in preparation, presented at WMIC 2017). The method
									consisted of injecting in the mice a per-fluoro nanoemulsion
									based on perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE-NE). These
									nanoparticles are rapidly taken up by circulating monocytes
									that bring them in the inflammation site. PFCE-NE suspension
									contained particles with a hydrodynamic size of 170±20nm (PDI
									0.07) with a total fluorine concentration of around 3.4 M. The
									recruitment of macrophages at the lesion site was successfully
									followed for 2 weeks, both by 19F-PRESS and MRI, displaying the
									higher signal enhancement in the first days post injury (pi)
									even if a constant and faint fluorine accumulation was
									detectable throughout the 14 days of monitoring. At days 2 and
									14 pi, the amount of fluorine at the lesion was 0.9 µmol and
									1.7 µmol, respectively. Ex-vivo validation by IF displayed a
									massive accumulation of particles at the lesion site, mainly
									phagocytized by peripheral and resident immune cells. <img

								<h3>
									<span style="text-transform: none;">Indocyanine Green labeling
										for optical and photoacoustic imaging of Mesenchymal Stem
										Cells after in vivo transplantation</span>
								</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									In this activity <a class="html"
										href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jbio.201800035"
										target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">[Filippi M. et al.
											2018]</span></a>, the potential of NIRF and Photoacoustic
									imaging in cellular imaging has been assessed labeling
									Mesenchymal Stem Cells with the clinically approved dye
									indocyanine green (ICG). Labelled cells were subsequently
									transplanted in healthy mice. The in vivo study was carried out
									by locally transplanting 3.0×10<sup>5</sup> ICG-labeled MSCs
									into the gastrocnemius muscle of the right hindlimb of healthy
									C57BL/6J mice. The site of cell deposition was clearly detected
									by US imaging (B-mode, 21 MHz), as a consequence of the change
									in the acoustic impedance determined by the dense inoculated
									cell mass. The PA signal intensity generated by the ICG-MSCs
									was normalized over the local endogenous baseline recorded in
									the left hindlimb of the animal where the transplantation of
									control unlabelled cells was performed.
								</p>

								<img src="images/research_3_8.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">

								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									The PA<sub>Enh</sub> was measured over the entire range of
									excitation wavelengths immediately after cell transplantation,
									then monitored over time, and reported as PA spectrum.
								</p>
								<img src="images/research_3_9.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Interestingly, immediately and 4 hours post-injection, the
									maximum peak recorded in the photoacoustic spectra was shifted
									towards high excitation wavelength values (890 and 920 nm,
									respectively), whereas from day 1 to day 4, the spectral shape
									reproduced the one observed in vitro with a maximum enhancement
									centred at around 810 nm. The normalized PA spectra acquired 7
									days post injection presented a flat shape without any
									discernable peak. After each PA acquisition, the mice underwent
									NIRF imaging in order to assess the fluorescent contrast
									enhancement (FLI<sub>Enh</sub>) produced by the transplanted
									cells. Interestingly, before progressively fading over days
									(likely due to the dye degradation and washout), the FLI<sub>Enh</sub>
									values followed an initial rising trend during the first 24 h
									after the engraftment deposition.
								</p>
								<img src="images/research_3_10.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">
								<p style="text-align: justify;">The coincident observation of
									extremely high PA amplitudes suggests that at early time points
									the strong intermolecular interactions among ICG molecules
									contribute to the quenching of the fluorescence, but results at
									the same time into an increase of the photoacoustic effect, due
									to photothermal conversion by nonradiative decay.</p>
