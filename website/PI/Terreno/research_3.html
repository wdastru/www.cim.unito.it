								<p align="justify">Tracking cells in vivo by using imaging approaches represents a 
								reliable method to assess the characteristics of cell grafts and to monitor their fate after
								 transplantation. In that respect, minimally invasive techniques with high spatial resolution 
								 are desirable with a view of implementing therapeutic protocols in the clinical ordinary. 
								 MRI is a leading imaging modality enabling the non-invasive visualization of cell populations
								  and their movements after transplantation in living animals with superb resolution. In order 
								  to be detectable, cells require to be adequately labelled with MRI contrast agents (CAs). 
								  Due to their excellent imaging efficiency, the superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles 
								  (SPIONs) are regarded as the gold standard in cell-labeling. However, some issues
									are associated with their contrast generation mechanism based on signal-loss (negative contrast). As a promising alternative, 
									paramagnetic CAs based on the metal Gadolinium (Gd) create a contrast increment (positive contrast) in T<sub>1</sub>-weighted (T<sub>1w</sub>) images, 
									overcoming several complications related to the use of SPIONs. Even if toxic in the form of free aqueous ion, Gadolinium is generally 
									considered safe when administered as a macrocyclic chelate and several agents have been approved for the clinical use so far. Differently 
									from magnetic nanoparticles, large amounts of paramagnetic small molecules have to be delivered to target sites in order to be detected, 
									and several labeling procedures have been developed to achieve this goal.
									In addition to Gd(III)-complexes, also fluorinated nanoparticles represent a valuable option for cellular imaging, especially for the 
									visualization of the macrophage recruitment in inflammation sites or to tracking dendritic cells. One of the advantages of <sup>19</sup>F-MRI is the possibility to quantify the signal and calculate the cellular content in the site of interest.
									Besides MRI, other imaging modalities can be used for tracking cells in vivo, like optical or photoacoustic imaging.

											The same model has been also used to assess the macrophagic infiltrate after the onset of the lesion 
											(Garello F. et al, manuscript in preparation, presented at WMIC 2017). The method consisted of injecting 
											in the mice a per-fluoro nanoemulsion based on perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE-NE). These nanoparticles 
											are rapidly taken up by circulating monocytes that bring them in the inflammation site.
											PFCE-NE suspension contained particles with a hydrodynamic size of 170±20nm (PDI 0.07) with a total fluorine concentration of around 3.4 M. 
											The recruitment of macrophages at the lesion site was successfully followed for 2 weeks, both by 19F-PRESS and MRI, displaying the higher signal 
											enhancement in the first days post injury (pi) even if a constant and faint fluorine accumulation was detectable throughout the 14 days of monitoring. 
											At days 2 and 14 pi, the amount of fluorine at the lesion was 0.9 µmol and 1.7 µmol, respectively. Ex-vivo validation by IF displayed a massive accumulation 
											of particles at the lesion site, mainly phagocytized by peripheral and resident immune cells.

											<p font style="text-transform: none; font-size:1.3em">Indocyanine Green labeling for optical and photoacoustic imaging of Mesenchymal Stem Cells after in vivo transplantation</p>
											<br>
										</header>
										<p align="justify">In this activity <a class="html" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jbio.201800035"
												target="_blank"><font color="blue">[Filippi M. et al. 2018]</font></a>, the potential of NIRF 
										and Photoacoustic imaging in cellular imaging has been assessed labeling Mesenchymal Stem Cells with the clinically 
										approved dye indocyanine green (ICG). Labelled cells were subsequently transplanted in healthy mice.
										The in vivo study was carried out by locally transplanting 3.0×10<sup>5</sup> ICG-labeled MSCs into the 
										gastrocnemius muscle of the right hindlimb of healthy C57BL/6J mice.
										The site of cell deposition was clearly detected by US imaging (B-mode, 21 MHz), as a consequence of the 
										change in the acoustic impedance determined by the dense inoculated cell mass.
										The PA signal intensity generated by the ICG-MSCs was normalized over the local endogenous baseline recorded in the left hindlimb of the animal 
										where the transplantation of control unlabelled cells was performed.																														
										</p>
										
										<img src="images/research_3_8.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">										
										
										<p align="justify">
										The PA<sub>Enh</sub> was measured over the entire range of excitation wavelengths immediately after cell transplantation, 
										then monitored over time, and reported as PA spectrum.</p>
										<img src="images/research_3_9.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">	
										<p align="justify">
										Interestingly, immediately and 4 hours post-injection, the maximum peak recorded in the photoacoustic spectra was 
										shifted towards high excitation wavelength values (890 and 920 nm, respectively), whereas from day 1 to day 4, the 
										spectral shape reproduced the one observed in vitro with a maximum enhancement centred at around 810 nm. The normalized PA 
										spectra acquired 7 days post injection presented a flat shape without any discernable peak. After each PA acquisition, 
										the mice underwent NIRF imaging in order to assess the fluorescent contrast enhancement (FLI<sub>Enh</sub>) produced by the transplanted 
										cells. Interestingly, before progressively fading over days (likely due to the dye degradation and washout), 
										the FLI<sub>Enh</sub> values followed an initial rising trend during the first 24 h after the engraftment deposition. </p>
										<img src="images/research_3_10.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">
										<p align="justify">
										The coincident observation of extremely high PA amplitudes suggests that at early time points the strong intermolecular 
										interactions among ICG molecules contribute to the quenching of the fluorescence, but results at the same time into an 
										increase of the photoacoustic effect, due to photothermal conversion by nonradiative decay.</p>
