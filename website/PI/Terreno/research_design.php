								<h3 font style="text-transform: none;">Design of targeting imaging probes</h3>
								<p align="justify">Active targeting is one of the most used approaches in pharmaceutical field 
								in order to improve the concentration of a molecule (therapeutics or in vivo diagnostics) at the 
								pathological site. Therefore, a targeting agent is a molecular system containing the â€œactive principleâ€� 
								(a drug or an imaging probe) conjugated to a vector that has to exhibit a high affinity and specificity 
								towards the biological target (cellular receptors, intracellular markers, enzymes, metabolite, extracellular 
								components, ...). Moreover, the success of the approach is also based on the accessibility of the biological 
								target by the targeting system. The design of a targeting imaging probe is affected by the sensitivity of 
								the imaging modality. For instance, to overcome the relatively low sensitivity in the contrast detection of MRI,
								 the targeting vector is conjugated to macromolecular or nanosized systems loaded with a high number of imaging 
								 units in order to significantly increase the contrast delivered at the biological target. On the contrary, 
								 in case of Optical or Nuclear imaging, sensibility is much better and a single fluorophore/radioisotope can be 
								 sufficient to generate enough signal from the disease marker.
								 Considering the accessibility issue, MRI targeting agents are very suitable for endothelial markers that do not 
								 require the extravasation of the â€œlargeâ€� probe, whereas optical probes can easily reach extracellular and intracellular targets.

											micelles decorated with an anti VCAM-1 peptide.</p>
										</header>
										
										<p align="justify">
											This activity deals with the synthesis of mixed micelles composed by DSPE-PEG2000 and the 
											amphiphilic Gd(III) complex GdDOTAMA(C18)<SUB>2</SUB>. The micelles were decorated with a cyclic peptide 
											known to have a high affinity towards the endothelial receptor VCAM-1, which is overexpressed 
											in presence of inflammation. In order to be loaded into the micelles the peptide was conjugated to a phospholipid.
										</p>
										<img src="images/research_1_1.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">
										<p align="justify">Paramagnetic mixed micelles targeting VCAM-1 displayed a hydrodynamic diameter of 20 nm
										with a PDI of 0.2. The millimolar longitudinal relaxivity (r1) at 0.5 T was 34.9 s<SUP>âˆ’1</SUP>mmolGd<SUP>âˆ’1</SUP> at 25Â°C 
										and 35.3 s<SUP>âˆ’1</SUP>mmolGd<SUP>âˆ’1</SUP> at 37Â°C. The relaxivity was also measured as a function of the proton Larmor 
										frequencies (from 0.01 to 70 MHz): </p>
										<img src="images/research_1_2.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">
										<p align="justify">
										The obtained NMRD (Nuclear Magnetic Relaxation Dispersion) profile is characterized by a relaxivity hump at ca. 20âˆ’30 MHz,
										 a feature that clearly indicates the occurrence of a restricted rotational motion for the paramagnetic Gd-complexes
										 in the micelles. The performance of this targeting system has been successfully tested on a mouse model of peripheral 
										 inflammation <a class="html" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.6b00308" target="_blank"><font color="blue">

										 [Garello F. et al, 2017] </font></a>.
										 The peripheral inflammation was generated by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the mouse leg skeletal muscles. 
									Conventional H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) histology confirmed the extensive infiltration of monocytes, 
									lymphocytes, and neutrophils in the leg 48 h after LPS injection.
									Furthermore, immunofluorescence experiments confirmed the expression of VCAM-1 receptors in the inflamed muscle.
									Forty-eight hours after the induction of inflammation, the
									paramagnetic micelles (containing the targeting or a scrambled untargeted peptide) were injected intravenously in the tail vein
									at a Gd dose of 55.0 Î¼mol/kg bw. Then, the animals (n = 6) were scanned by MRI (at 1 T) over a period of 24 h postinjection.

									At T1 contrast enhancement around 45% was observed in the inflamed region 4 h post-injection The contrast measured in the inflamed 
									leg was ca. 5-fold higher than the enhancement detected in the contralateral healthy leg, and 2-fold higher than the response 
									measured upon administration of the control micelles functionalized with the scrambled peptide. The MR images reported below show
									that 4 h after the injection of the micelles, a hyperintense signal
									was visible in the inflamed leg (red circle), while no brightening was detected in the control experiment. </p>

										<p align="justify">The accumulation of the MRI agent in the legs was confirmed by ICP-MS analysis, which showed that the 
										amount of metal ion in the inflamed muscles after the injection of the VCAM-1-targeted micelles was ca. 40% higher than 
										the amount found in the diseased tissue after the injection of the control micelles loaded with the scrambled peptide 
										and ca. 3-fold higher with respect to the Gd found in the healthy muscles regardless of the type of micelles injected.

										<p align="justify">The neuroinflammation model was prepared through a local injection of (LPS) in the right striatum. 
										The presence of inflammation and the over-expression of VCAM-1 in the involved hemisphere were detectable already 24 h 
										after surgery by ex-vivo histology, whereas no hallmarks of inflammation were present in the contra-lateral hemisphere. 
										The animals were enrolled in the study 24 h after LPS injection, received intravenous administration of VCAM-1 targeted 
										micelles (0.05 mmolGd/kg bw) and were imaged at 1.0 T at 20 min, 4 h, 24 h and 48 h post injection to monitor micelle 
										homing to the site of inflammation.</p>

										The T1 signal enhancement calculated over pre-images, reached a peak value 24 h post micelle injection, with a 
										statistically significant difference between diseased and healthy hemispheres.
										To ascertain the specificity of the administered nanosystem, a comparison with micelles bearing the untargeted scrambled 
										peptide was conducted. The results obtained displayed a statistically significant difference in the % T1-SE of the inflamed 
										striatum between targeted and non-targeted micelles at 24 h p.i. (39.3 Â± 4.4 vs. 18.9 Â± 2.2%, respectively, ANOVA P values = 0.003.											
										</p>
										<img src="images/research_1_6.jpg" alt="" class="image zooming">
																										
										<p align="justify">
										At the other time points, no statistically significant differences between the two nanosystems were detected.
										Interestingly, the kinetic of the contrast enhancement observed for the two nanosystems was a bit different, with the targeted system that performed much better after 24 h post-injection, whereas at 48 h the two micelles showed a very similar effect. Most likely, this observation is an indirect demonstration of the effective targeting of the VCAM-1 directed system, and it suggests that the targeting to the receptor (though, likely, it is not the only process accounting for the accumulation of the probe in the inflamed area) is a faster event than the passive accumulation occurring for the untargeted micelles.
										The signal obtained 24 h post injection of the scrambled micelles was definitely comparable to the T1-SE detected 20 min after the
										administration of the contrast agent MultiHance (13.4% Â± 2.7%), which is clinically employed to evaluate the presence of alterations in blood brain barrier permeability. This finding suggests that the
										contrast obtained after the administration of scrambled micelles is
										mainly related to passive extravasation, thus further supporting the
										view that VCAM-1 targeted micelles effectively bind the corresponding target in vivo.
