								<p>The <b>Molecular Imaging Center</b> participates as a Node in the European Research Infrastructure for Imaging Technologies in Biological 
								and Biomedical Sciences (Euro-BioImaging, EuBI)  with the laboratories of the University of Torino located  at the Department of Molecular 
								Biotechnology and Health Sciences and at the BioIndustry Park Silvano Fumero (Center of Excellence for Preclinical Imaging - CEIP). 
								It offers specific expertise in the field of probe design, development and evaluation both in cell cultures and in small animal models 
								(probes for all the different imaging modalities, including hybrid modalities, and for different biological applications such as visualization 
								of biological parameters and enzyme activities, targeting of specific cells/tissues, etc.).</p>

										Commission launched the Euro-Bioimaging ERIC</h2>


									<p>Euro-BioImaging has been officially established by the
										European Commission as a European Research Infrastructure
										Consortium (ERIC). With its ERIC status, Euro-BioImaging is
										now legally recognised as European research infrastructure for
										biological and biomedical imaging. Euro-BioImaging offers life
										scientists open access to imaging instruments, expertise,
										training opportunities and data management services that they
										do not find at their home institutions or among their
										collaboration partners. All scientists, regardless of
										affiliation, area of expertise or field of activity, can
										benefit from these pan-European open access services.
										Euro-BioImaging will ensure excellent research and development
										across the life sciences in Europe by offering
										state-of-the-art imaging services through its internationally
										renowned facilities, called Nodes. These Nodes are distributed
										across its 15 founding members: Austria, Bulgaria, Czech
										Republic, Denmark, EMBL, Finland, France, Hungary, Israel,
										Italy, Norway, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the UK.
										Belgium will participate as an observer. All Euro-BioImaging
										services are accessible via <a href="http://www.eurobioimaging.eu/">www.eurobioimaging.eu</a>.
										Establishment of the Euro-BioImaging ERIC builds on over 10
										years of preparatory work with active engagement of 25
										national imaging communities, the international organisation
										EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory), and EIBIR
										(European Institute for Biomedical Imaging Research. The in
										vivo/medical imaging section of the Euro-BioImaging Hub,
										coordinating access to biomedical imaging Nodes, will be
										managed by Italy through the Unit of the CNR Institute of
										BioStructures and Bioimages (IBB) operating at the University
										of Torino. Furthermore, the University of Torino coordinates
										the Multi-Modal Molecular Imaging Italian Node
										(mmmi.unito.it).</p>
