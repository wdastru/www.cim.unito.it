								<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive technology that generates high-resolution 
								images of tissues and organs. Since its first use on a human being over 40 years ago, it 
								has become instrumental in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease and injury. Functional MRI, 
								invented in 1991, is based on the same principles but images metabolic activity indirectly via 
								changes in blood flow. Its use has led to remarkable discoveries in biomedical research. 
								Now, PRIMOGAIA is exploiting MRI technology to map and quantify enzyme activity in pathological 
								tissue. Enzymes play critical roles in cellular metabolism and are already valuable biomarkers 
								of pathology in blood tests. Now, their high-resolution spatial localisation in tissues will 
								significantly enhance disease detection and monitoring. PrimoGaia brings together an interdisciplinary 
								consortium of research teams from 4 academics: Aix-Marseille University, U Mons, U Torino (reagents), 
								CNRS Bordeaux (EPR unit, sequences, biology); Fraunhofer (Physics) and 2 companies: "Stelar" 
								(magnetic unit) and "Pure Devices" an innovative SME (MRI instrumentation).</p>

								<p>The Horizon 2020 project GLINT aims to develop a potentially disruptive new 
								diagnostic tool and a set of technologies for cancer imaging which will allow for 
								earlier, more accurate and more reliable cancer diagnosis.
								Cancer is one of the most devastating diseases the world is currently facing. 
								It is usually detected through advanced medical imaging, and early detection remains 
								a decisive factor for increasing the chances of survival and the potential for full 
								recovery. The GLINT project addresses the current global lack of safe, cheap, easily 
								accessible and accurate image-based metabolic evaluation techniques to detect cancer 
								and will develop an innovative diagnostic tool and a set of technologies for in vivo 
								cancer imaging which can characterise and image glucose delivery, uptake and metabolism 
								in cancer. Once the GLINT project is successful, patients will be able to benefit from 
								a non-invasive, radiation-free method for cancer assessment.

										Commission launched the Euro-Bioimaging ERIC</h2>


									<p>Euro-BioImaging has been officially established by the
										European Commission as a European Research Infrastructure
										Consortium (ERIC). With its ERIC status, Euro-BioImaging is
										now legally recognised as European research infrastructure for
										biological and biomedical imaging. Euro-BioImaging offers life
										scientists open access to imaging instruments, expertise,
										training opportunities and data management services that they
										do not find at their home institutions or among their
										collaboration partners. All scientists, regardless of
										affiliation, area of expertise or field of activity, can
										benefit from these pan-European open access services.
										Euro-BioImaging will ensure excellent research and development
										across the life sciences in Europe by offering
										state-of-the-art imaging services through its internationally
										renowned facilities, called Nodes. These Nodes are distributed
										across its 15 founding members: Austria, Bulgaria, Czech
										Republic, Denmark, EMBL, Finland, France, Hungary, Israel,
										Italy, Norway, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the UK.
										Belgium will participate as an observer. All Euro-BioImaging
										services are accessible via <a href="http://www.eurobioimaging.eu/">www.eurobioimaging.eu</a>.
										Establishment of the Euro-BioImaging ERIC builds on over 10
										years of preparatory work with active engagement of 25
										national imaging communities, the international organisation
										EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory), and EIBIR
										(European Institute for Biomedical Imaging Research. The in
										vivo/medical imaging section of the Euro-BioImaging Hub,
										coordinating access to biomedical imaging Nodes, will be
										managed by Italy through the Unit of the CNR Institute of
										BioStructures and Bioimages (IBB) operating at the University
										of Torino. Furthermore, the University of Torino coordinates
										the Multi-Modal Molecular Imaging Italian Node
										(mmmi.unito.it).</p>
