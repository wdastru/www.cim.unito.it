								<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive technology
									that generates high-resolution images of tissues and organs.
									Since its first use on a human being over 40 years ago, it has
									become instrumental in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease
									and injury. Functional MRI, invented in 1991, is based on the
									same principles but images metabolic activity indirectly via
									changes in blood flow. Its use has led to remarkable
									discoveries in biomedical research. Now, PRIMOGAIA is
									exploiting MRI technology to map and quantify enzyme activity
									in pathological tissue. Enzymes play critical roles in cellular
									metabolism and are already valuable biomarkers of pathology in
									blood tests. Now, their high-resolution spatial localisation in
									tissues will significantly enhance disease detection and
									monitoring. PrimoGaia brings together an interdisciplinary
									consortium of research teams from 4 academics: Aix-Marseille
									University, U Mons, U Torino (reagents), CNRS Bordeaux (EPR
									unit, sequences, biology); Fraunhofer (Physics) and 2
									companies: "Stelar" (magnetic unit) and "Pure Devices" an
									innovative SME (MRI instrumentation).</p>

									H2020 GLINT project</h2>
								<p>The Horizon 2020 project GLINT aims to develop a potentially
									disruptive new diagnostic tool and a set of technologies for
									cancer imaging which will allow for earlier, more accurate and
									more reliable cancer diagnosis. Cancer is one of the most
									devastating diseases the world is currently facing. It is
									usually detected through advanced medical imaging, and early
									detection remains a decisive factor for increasing the chances
									of survival and the potential for full recovery. The GLINT
									project addresses the current global lack of safe, cheap,
									easily accessible and accurate image-based metabolic evaluation
									techniques to detect cancer and will develop an innovative
									diagnostic tool and a set of technologies for in vivo cancer
									imaging which can characterise and image glucose delivery,
									uptake and metabolism in cancer. Once the GLINT project is
									successful, patients will be able to benefit from a
									non-invasive, radiation-free method for cancer assessment.

								launched the Euro-Bioimaging ERIC</h2>
							<p>
								Euro-BioImaging has been officially established by the European
								Commission as a European Research Infrastructure Consortium
								(ERIC). With its ERIC status, Euro-BioImaging is now legally
								recognised as European research infrastructure for biological
								and biomedical imaging. Euro-BioImaging offers life scientists
								open access to imaging instruments, expertise, training
								opportunities and data management services that they do not find
								at their home institutions or among their collaboration
								partners. All scientists, regardless of affiliation, area of
								expertise or field of activity, can benefit from these
								pan-European open access services. Euro-BioImaging will ensure
								excellent research and development across the life sciences in
								Europe by offering state-of-the-art imaging services through its
								internationally renowned facilities, called Nodes. These Nodes
								are distributed across its 15 founding members: Austria,
								Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, EMBL, Finland, France,
								Hungary, Israel, Italy, Norway, Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden
								and the UK. Belgium will participate as an observer. All
								Euro-BioImaging services are accessible via <a
									href="http://www.eurobioimaging.eu/">www.eurobioimaging.eu</a>.
								Establishment of the Euro-BioImaging ERIC builds on over 10
								years of preparatory work with active engagement of 25 national
								imaging communities, the international organisation EMBL
								(European Molecular Biology Laboratory), and EIBIR (European
								Institute for Biomedical Imaging Research. The in vivo/medical
								imaging section of the Euro-BioImaging Hub, coordinating access
								to biomedical imaging Nodes, will be managed by Italy through
								the Unit of the CNR Institute of BioStructures and Bioimages
								(IBB) operating at the University of Torino. Furthermore, the
								University of Torino coordinates the Multi-Modal Molecular
								Imaging Italian Node (mmmi.unito.it).
